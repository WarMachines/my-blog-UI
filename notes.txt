1. Setting-up react
    a. npx create-react-app "folder name". (run this command to create the react project)
    b. npm start (To run the project).

2. Set Up Routes using three imports from 'react-router-dom'
    a. BrowserRouter
    b. Route
    c. Switch
    Here BrowserRouter is the parent element for all the Routes( look into App.js of front end)
    Each Route element has path (what path is reqested from the browser) and component (what page should be shown on the Route)

3. Link the pages which basically means assign links to element to Route
    a. This can done using normal anchor link.
    b. Or in react we have Link control which can be imported from 'react-router-dom (look into NavBar.js file)
